\begin{problem}{1}
  This is a four-part problem.
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Let $L$ be the set of leaves of the minimum-height protocol
      tree for $f$ that
      give output 1. For each $l \in L$, let $M_l$ be the matrix which
      is 1 on the input pairs whose path through the protocol tree
      ends at the lead $l$. By the definition of a protocol tree,
      $M_l$ can also be defined by a set $X$ and $Y$ with:
      \begin{equation}
        M_l[i,j] = 1 \iff i \in X, j \in Y
      \end{equation}
      Thus, there are two possible rows in
      $M_l$, either all zeros or 1 precisely on indices in $Y$. Thus,
      the rank of $M_l$ is 1, regardless of what field the rank is
      taken over.

      Note that:
      \begin{equation}
        M_f = \sum_{l \in L} M_l
      \end{equation}

      Since rank is subadditive, we can conclude:

      \begin{equation}
        rank(M_f) \leq \sum_{l \in L} rank(M_l) = |L| \leq 2^{D(f)}
      \end{equation}

      The last inequality holds since $L$ is a subset of leaves of a
      tree of height $D(f)$. We can then conclude

      \begin{equation}
        log_2(rank(M_f)) \leq D(f)
      \end{equation}
