# Advanced Complexity Theory, 18.405J / 6.841J
Answers to problem sets for MIT OpenCourseWare's Advanced Complexity
Theory class, aka 18.405J / 6.841J . . They correspond to [this
version](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-405j-advanced-complexity-theory-spring-2016/)
of the course.

If you find errors or have questions about the problem sets, please
feel free to file an issue! Keep in mind, this is a work in progress.

One random tip - on problem set 3, the first problem gives you a hint that
you should look on Piazza for a certain proof. We members of the
public don't have access to Piazza, but it seems that proof is also
available on page 4 of
[these](http://www.tcs.tifr.res.in/~prahladh/teaching/2011-12/comm/lectures/l03.pdf)
lecture notes.
